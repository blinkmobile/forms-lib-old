# Forms: Definition Structure

We expect Forms definitions to be valid JSON. This document explains the
expected structure of this JSON.

For low-level validation, see the
[JSON Schema specification](http://json-schema.org/) and our JSON
[schema](schema.json).


## Defaults and Variations

The property names at the root of the definition are the names of Variations.
Variations are frequently directly related to certain modes or actions.

There is a special property name `default` to establish Default settings.
These take precedence whenever an available Variation is not more appropriate.

```json
{
  "default": {
    "name": "my-form"
  },
  "add": {}
}
```

Common Variation names include "add", "edit", "list", etc. Variations can have
any name, and any special behaviour associated with them is the responsibility
of the consumer of the definition.

Unless explicitly specified, we will consider `default` a Variation, and we
include it when we document Variations.

The `default` Variation is mandatory, all other Variations are optional.

### Contents

Variations contain [Settings](settings.md) and lists of
[Components](components.md).
