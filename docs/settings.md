## Reserved Property Names, Dangling Underscores

Certain properties have special meaning for code that consumes your definition.
We prefix these properties with underscores so that they do not clash with
current or future settings. As such, avoid prefixing properties with
underscores.

See [Components](components.md) for more information about reserved properties.
